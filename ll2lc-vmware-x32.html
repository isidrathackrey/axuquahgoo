Hi All, I am running my lab in VMware Workstation 12. I have created an ESXi on which I have created a x32 VM running windows server 2003. I followed many articles and they all suggested to enabled below settings on the x32 VM replay.supported = "true" replay.allowFT = "true" replay.allowBTOnly = "true" I have enabled the settings. When the x32 VM is powered down I am able to enable FT. However I try to power on the x32 VM it returns an error Binary translation with Record/Replay gpu-z - —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞ –¥–ª—è –≤—ã–≤–æ–¥–∞ –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –æ –≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –∞–¥–∞–ø—Ç–µ—Ä–µ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ–∫–∞—Ä—Ç—ã nvidia Wondering what everyone runs their Rockwell software in operating system wise and how it performs. 1.

Question: I would like to ask for help in understanding the best approach for the following hardware below and using my VMUG Advantage membership which gives me VMware vSphere with Operations Management Enterprise Plus v6.5. I'm having a difficult time understanding how to best setup each physical NIC for ESXi management, vSAN, vMotion, etc. I already have the drivers loaded for the NICs and they are working correctly. I just don't know what is the best approach.

Yes, I am aware 2003 is out of support and 2008 is going to be soon. Normally I would just build out a 2012 system and these guys would reload their apps but, apparently they no longer have the source for their app. So in order to buy some time and get off of 2003, we are upgrading to 2008. So, I have this 2003 server that I P2V'd to our VMWare environment. This went fine. No issues. The server is up, tools installed, old HP hardware services uninstalled, etc. I mount

SOLVED!! ampnbsp; I have a very hefty PC, but my gf has a shitty Toshiba laptop. Currently, we can't afford a new PC for her, but we want to buy ESO while it's on sale. Is there any way we could both play on two different accounts with two controllers on one PC? ampnbsp; EDIT: I tried running x32 and x64 versions on two different monitors. This works just fine with ultra graphic settings and decent fps, but input does not work on the inactive window.

I am trying to deploy a new golden image. We have multiple HP printers throughout our environment that are mapped via GPO. All of the HP printers will print a few times then freeze up whatever program you are trying print from. It only seems to be HP printers. I have tried multiple ways to pre-load the drivers on golden images to no avail, every solution i have tried has not worked. If it try and install a printer using the prompt - it fails at "installing" and freezes in traditional. –£–≤–∞–∂–∞–µ–º—ã–π –ø–æ—Å–µ—Ç–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å, –í—ã –∑–∞—à–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–π—Ç –∫–∞–∫ –Ω–µ–∑–∞—Ä–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å. We're going to be moving our physical 2008sp2 x32 box over to a VM as well as get it to 2012x64. This server is our DHCP/DNS/AD server. There are numerous ways to do this and I was wondering what you guys thought before attempting it, my main concession is that we want to keep the same DNS name and with option 2 (below) I don't know how that would work. 1.

Hey all, I'm a print administrator at a community college, and my team is in charge of upgrading our print servers from 2003 R2 to 2008. We have tried numerous times to perform the upgrade, but when we get to "Expanding Files," we immediately receive an error that: "Windows cannot install required files. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code: 0x8007001F." We have tried the steps below to no avail. Please help! 1) Backup printers.

One of the people on our team is suggesting installing fiber optic cable to another building 100 yards away. I don't feel this is necessary because the same ISP is providing service to two buildings. In addition to this, security provided through Cisco routers and switches should be adequate to protect any proprietary information. Here's what I've written up so far. Nothing is going to be installed, this is just a paper we're writing for a PC Support class. In our company we have a major problem with ESXi 5.1 and VMs running on it. The problem is that VMs on ESXi are shown as eating too much of server's CPU resources. This happens only with the VMs running the crypto-software developed by our company, which is a modified FreeBSD 8.3 x32 (or a hybrid of CentOSampRedHat in the newest alpha-versions of our company's product, and the bug is present there too). None of those machines have "vmware tools" (someone said that's because there Posting the following according to the instruction given in konsole: Code: emerge -pqv '=media-libs/mesa-10.5.2' ebuild R media-libs/mesa-10.5.2 USE="classic dri3 egl gallium gbm llvm nptl udev xa -bindist -d3d9 -debug -gles1 -gles2 -opencl -openmax -osmesa -pax_kernel -pic (-selinux) -vaapi -vdpau -wayland -xvmc" ABI_X86="(64) -32 (-x32)" VIDEO_CARDS="nouveau (-freedreno) -i915 -i965 -ilo -intel -r100 -r200 -r300 -r600 -radeon -radeonsi -vmware" emerge --info http://pastebin.com/DvzZRiM. Once I open VMware Fusion using Windows 10 32 bit i get an error saying "The guest attempted to read beyond the end of a disc image. The image at /Users/(myname)/Desktop/Windows10_InsiderPreview_x32_EN-US_10162.iso might be incomplete or corrupt." I have followed all the steps in this video( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhgBQeMrVnE ) very closely and get stuck at this every.
