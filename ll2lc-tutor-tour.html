                            <p> TL;DR - therapy has never worked for me, and I really want it to. Any advice on how to find someone who is a good match for me? Or do I require something else aside from therapy? Any comments ? TW mentions of s xual violence. Hi everyone. I am a 21 year old female. I never really liked talking about my feelings; I much prefer to reflect internally on my problems and then act to manage them. That said, I have always been able to talk to my friends and loved ones, so I really don't think. Every once in a while, you'll come across a show that prominently features children. The children are actual stars, and you can't really replace them with adults. They're talented and do the job as well as any of the adults. But they're clearly elementary-aged, and it's not like Hollywood where you can just show up to film some scenes and go home for the day. For shows like Les Misérables, the actors have to actually tour the country, traveling from one major city to another. How do they reconc. Spikes! I'm thrilled you all are finding your Origins! A simple reminder on our spoiler policies here at /r/spikes: 1. Feel free to talk about individual cards. Many cards have posts related to them - chat there! 2. You can even talk about potential archetypes for new cards! 3. Something you can't do - Please do not post decks  As decks are naturally untested at this point - and, more importantly, because the full set has not yet been revealed - they are not deemed competitive. Hello! I'm planning on making the jump and getting my tour guide license. I'm a recent history graduate, so I know most of the history, I just need some advice on how to attack the test. Willing to pay 15 an hour, greatly appreciated. Hi all. :) Am looking to go to SJFC or Roberts Wesleyan when I am done over at MCC, to work on ending up with a masters and possibly a doctorate in nursing. How do you guys think the school is over there? Pros/cons? My ex-gf went there but we broke up shortly after she started and then she transferred to MCC and we are most definitely not on speaking terms. I think it is rather pretty and food prices seem normal for a campus, but it's always better to hear from the people who actually go there. Hey guys! I hope it's okay to post this here, someone in r/cycling suggested posting to this subreddit. I designed the website for the inaugural 2014 Tour for Dyslexia, and I want to help spread the word about it. (And I would also appreciate any feedback on the site!) At the age of SEVENTY, Larry Emigh biked across the country to raise money for tutoring children with dyslexia. He raised about ,000 and biked 3,000+ miles. Now he's organizing a bike ride in central Pennsylvania 
I am interested in taking my play further than just FNM. I just don't know seasons, what is in play right now, and where to go to get into the next (pro tour?) tourney. Thanks for help in advance. # MAME 0.209 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=468) With another month over, it’s time for another release, and MAME 0.209 is sure to have something to interest everyone.

Development Diary XIX: Eastern Winds ----------------------------- gt “The Chinese people have only family and clan solidarity; they do not have national spirit.they are just a heap of loose sand.Other men are the carving knife and serving dish; we are the fish and the meat.” gt - Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, 1924 ----------------------------- Hello, and welcome back to another development diary for The New Order! Today’s diary will take us from the smoldering ruins of Chongqing Hi all, I'm a former high school math teacher that still tutors on the side. There is a student that I work with who is essentially in Algebra I. Her and her family are about to go on vacation for the next several weeks. I want to take this opportunity to give her work that is slightly different than what we would normally do. In particular, I want to give her a math book to read. Ideally, I want to give her some kind of text that might peak her curiosity or show her something that she hadn't. Alternative title: I follow in /u/Stuart98's example and exterminate any and all T-shirt spammers that dare step foot in /r/DDLC 1. /u/AbleAcanthocephala6 1. /u/AdministrativeMall8 1. /u/Administrative_Total 1. /u/AggressiveConstant7 1. /u/Ajhgdee778 1. /u/AlternativeBarber7 1. /u/Amazing_Drive 1. /u/Androwsaimon 1. /u/Apart_Cup 1. /u/CandidLingonberry 1. /u/CapableTour 1. /u/ComplexBarracuda 1. /u/DeliciousDiscount1 1. /u/DifficultScreen4 1. /u/DranishWhite 1. /u/Elegant_Opposite This is probably going to be a long post, so please refer to the TL;DR for a summarized version of this post. I'm a 26/M and we've been dating for 5 years. If you had asked me if I ever saw my life without my 25/F girlfriend in it 2 years ago, the answer would've been a no, without a shadow of a doubt. From the moment we met that she was the shining light of my world, she and her then 9 month old baby girl (the baby's father is a deadbeat who ran when he found out about the pregnancy Hi y'all, LTL FTP, on mobile, etc etc etc, enjoy! TL:DR @ the bottom. Also, this was about 6 years ago, so the conversation is paraphrased but as accurate as my memory serves. This was a few years ago, I was 16 and just out of high school. At my school, finalists finished a solid two months before the lower years, so I was on summer break but the rest of the school was still in session. I'm trying hard not to sound braggy, but it's important to the story that I was the smartest This is not how I prefer to spend my Sunday afternoons, but after seeing the “argument” by /u/Se-lena, I felt compelled to respond. TL;DR : /u/Se-lena’s post is a weak argument, and relies on readers to take the post at face value, uses only a single bias source as reference, and relies on salacious rumour and lurid innuendo to make the “ appeal to emotion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion)” logical fallacy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) in order to convince readers. 
So, another column of thoughts about the.welp. new meta now.as usual, easy to find topics, with a TL;DR at the end. This is more a reaction to the patch and its precedents, and I’ll have more deckbuilding meta thoughts in the near future. TGP told me to post this here, since it's less deck/meta related, but more meta-meta. OVERALL PATCH SENTIMENT—BUFFS GOOD, NERFS BAD: now, a heads up—a lot of criticism is going to take place in this post. But it isn’t because I’m necessarily disappo. June 28, 1914 Sarajevo, Bosnia It was already uncomfortably humid as the early morning sun rose over the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The city was wide awake—it had been since before dawn—its numerous cafes and coffee shops filled with village chit-chat between citizens starting off their day. Old men with long, white beards sat at the tables and bars, lit cigarettes, and gossiped. Some of the wealthier gentlemen wore fez caps with their jackets and wool trousers while members. Hey fellow Karn enthusiasts, this past weekend at SCG Cleveland I ended up borrowing mono green tron for the weekend. The Tuesday before the tournament I was fully on board for running Phoenix, however I asked myself if I felt like playing the mirror every other round and decided I'd rather have fun playing magic. Funny enough I didn't play against Izzet Phoenix once. I didn't expect very positive results given this was only the second time playing tron in a tournament. However, my results. </p>
