My windows won't boot (I was unsuccessful in moving Windows.old) and I'd like to do some cleanup before re-installing Windows. Is there a simple file manager utility with graphical interface that I boot directly from CD and read my drivers as they are?

Ive been out of the loop for a while, I'm on 9.3.2. I have my 10.3.2 blobs saved and I was first off wondering if a 10.3.2 JB is ever possible and second if a dual boot utility for 64 bit devices is even possible in the first place.

I finally recently purchased an SSD (a cheap one unfortunately, but still loads better than the HDD I was using). I've made sure I've got it connected to my one of my SATA 6gb/s slots. That's working fine, fast boot speeds, nice. Now, the questions concerning the MoBo and BIOS. My (as far as I know) currently updated BIOS shows settings for Fast Boot (Windows 8) to turn off certain devices to encourage faster boot speeds.

I've been looking for a decent USB boot utility for Linux for quite a while now. On Windows I've been perfectly happy with Rufus ( (single ISOs) and YUMI ( (for multiple ISOs). I have tested quite a few, but never got close to any of the Windows equivalent tools. Either the tools had problems recognising the ISO files and often were not able to successfully make the ISO files bootable, that were recognised. Multipl. 
A little background, my company has an employee buyback program where we can purchase old laptops, desktops and servers at a greatly reduced cost. These are always "As is" and I've had a few great buys, but also a few really big duds. I'm currently looking at a server that will be great for a VM to run a Minecraft server, among other things, but I want to run some tests before I buy it. Is there a set of utilities, Linux or otherwise that I can boot from USB, to test the HDD, memory Alright do the title convers it. I'm a sys admin that just got this dumped on my desk and I'm at a loss. I tried booting an old snow Leopard cd I had on hand but it won't take. Internet recovery ( cmd opt r) and disk utility ( opt) don't work either. It just goes to that awful blinking question mark folder. Any ideas I keep getting an error message saying that "Setup was unable to create a new system partition or locate an existing partition." I'm looking for something similar to the links below, I am just trying to see if there are any other good options. I am looking for a mid to high top shoe / boot with a streetwear type of look. Could be for winter or summer, doesn't really matter. Any recommendations welcome, thanks. 1 https://www.converse.com/us/en_us/c/converse/limited-edition/urban-utility-collection https://i2.wp.com/www.nicekicks.com/files/2017/11/HO17_SLAMJAM_JUMP_BOOT_UTILITY.jpg?resize=1140%2C760 2 https://d3n. ~~I tried to post this in r/buildapcforme, but the automod wouldn't allow it since it's not a request using the template.

To begin with a description of what happened, I used the windows 10 .iso, or whatever the boot utility is called on the disk. I didn't expect it to serrate out a 30 gig partition and screw all other data. I am not sure if it was formatted, or what exactly happened. I am not sure if I could somehow adjust the w10 start up partion in such a way as to restore the data. If that is possible my question changes to that, or rather encompasses it. amp#x200B; Secondly, I used recoverit Hey guys! PC user here and I just got a second hand MacBook pro, but everytime I boot it takes me into boot utilities and it would appear there is nothing to boot from or a time machine restore point. No idea how it happened. Got it like this. Is it just a matter of downloading Yosemite and install? I don't have a disk or bag me even an Apple account. Is it still possible? I have no problem t0rrenting the OS, but beyond that I have no idea. Any help would be greatly appreciated. PC runs fine as far as I can tell but the problem is I cant get into the bios to do anything and well. I've never heard of this before. I have noooooo idea what to do here. Weve tried different display cables just for giggles but I dont see what effect that would have to the same result. CMOS reset as well to no avail. I hope were both having brain farts and missing something blatantly obvious. I7-7700k Z270 Gaming M7 EVGA 1080 x2 SLI 32gb Corsair Dominator Ram 1000w Corsair PSU Edit:.

So, pretty much what the title says. I have an ASUS EEEBOOK (x205ta) with windows 10 pre-installed on which I am trying to install a lightweight linux distro. I've made a bootable USB drive with the Lubuntu 64 bit iso on Rufus 3.5 with both a GPT/MBR partition scheme with the target system set to UEFI(non-CSM) and also BIOS or UEFI, both with a fat32 file system.

Every single time I want to use my laptop I have to go through 5-6 restarts before it boots up properly. I haven't found any solution to this problem anywhere. Hi everyone, I'm getting a new processor later today which I plan on overclocking. Before it gets here, I was going to update the firmware on my motherboard ( ASUS P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3 LGA 1155 Intel Z68 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard (https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131790) ) but I cannot get into the BIOS. I hammer on delete, which is supposedly the key and it goes to windows everytime. Despite my mobo saying it is uefi enabled, windows tells I bought a couple SDcards from Wish and so far performance is good enough for storage and some vm usage (I set up vms using SSD then migrate to SDcard for usage). I have the SurfaceBook I5 8 gig and the SurfacePro 3 i5 8 gig. With the SurfaceBook I have used the BaseQI adapter (link below) for a couple years and love it. The Surface devices have nice hidden ports but the Books not so much. Pretty much the thing I have found about the BaseQI adapter is this: 1.

Alright, so, sorry for that title! I finally recently purchased an SSD (a cheap one unfortunately, but still loads better than the HDD I was using). I've made sure I've got it connected to my one of my SATA 6gb/s slots. That's working fine, fast boot speeds, nice. Now, the questions concerning the MoBo and BIOS. My (as far as I know) currently updated BIOS shows settings for Fast Boot (Windows 8) to turn off certain devices to encourage faster boot speeds. MSI also offers, through their websit.

I've been looking for a decent USB boot utility for Linux for quite a while now. On Windows I've been perfectly happy with Rufus ( (single ISOs) and YUMI ( (for multiple ISOs). I have tested quite a few, but never got close to any of the Windows equivalent tools. Either the tools had problems recognising the ISO files and often were not able to successfully make the ISO files bootable, that were recognised. Multipl. A little background, my company has an employee buyback program where we can purchase old laptops, desktops and servers at a greatly reduced cost. These are always "As is" and I've had a few great buys, but also a few really big duds. I'm currently looking at a server that will be great for a VM to run a Minecraft server, among other things, but I want to run some tests before I buy it. Is there a set of utilities, Linux or otherwise that I can boot from USB, to test the HDD, memory Alright do the title convers it. I'm a sys admin that just got this dumped on my desk and I'm at a loss. I tried booting an old snow Leopard cd I had on hand but it won't take. Internet recovery ( cmd opt r) and disk utility ( opt) don't work either. It just goes to that awful blinking question mark folder. Any ideas I keep getting an error message saying that "Setup was unable to create a new system partition or locate an existing partition." I'm looking for something similar to the links below, I am just trying to see if there are any other good options. I am looking for a mid to high top shoe / boot with a streetwear type of look.

To begin with a description of what happened, I used the windows 10 .iso, or whatever the boot utility is called on the disk. I didn't expect it to serrate out a 30 gig partition and screw all other data. I am not sure if it was formatted, or what exactly happened. I am not sure if I could somehow adjust the w10 start up partion in such a way as to restore the data. If that is possible my question changes to that, or rather encompasses it. amp#x200B; Secondly, I used recoverit Hey guys! PC user here and I just got a second hand MacBook pro, but everytime I boot it takes me into boot utilities and it would appear there is nothing to boot from or a time machine restore point. No idea how it happened. Got it like this. Is it just a matter of downloading Yosemite and install? I don't have a disk or bag me even an Apple account. Is it still possible? I have no problem t0rrenting the OS, but beyond that I have no idea. Any help would be greatly appreciated. PC runs fine as far as I can tell but the problem is I cant get into the bios to do anything and well. I've never heard of this before. I have noooooo idea what to do here. Weve tried different display cables just for giggles but I dont see what effect that would have to the same result. CMOS reset as well to no avail.

So, pretty much what the title says. I have an ASUS EEEBOOK (x205ta) with windows 10 pre-installed on which I am trying to install a lightweight linux distro. I've made a bootable USB drive with the Lubuntu 64 bit iso on Rufus 3.5 with both a GPT/MBR partition scheme with the target system set to UEFI(non-CSM) and also BIOS or UEFI, both with a fat32 file system. While my BIOS is recognizing the drive in the boot option and letting me configure it to the first boot priority Every single time I want to use my laptop I have to go through 5-6 restarts before it boots up properly. I haven't found any solution to this problem anywhere. Hi everyone, I'm getting a new processor later today which I plan on overclocking. Before it gets here, I was going to update the firmware on my motherboard ( ASUS P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3 LGA 1155 Intel Z68 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard (https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131790) ) but I cannot get into the BIOS. I hammer on delete, which is supposedly the key and it goes to windows everytime. Despite my mobo saying it is uefi enabled, windows tells I bought a couple SDcards from Wish and so far performance is good enough for storage and some vm usage (I set up vms using SSD then migrate to SDcard for usage). I have the SurfaceBook I5 8 gig and the SurfacePro 3 i5 8 gig. With the SurfaceBook I have used the BaseQI adapter (link below) for a couple years and love it. The Surface devices have nice hidden ports but the Books not so much. Pretty much the thing I have found about the BaseQI adapter is this: 1.
